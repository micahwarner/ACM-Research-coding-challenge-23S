## Problem Description

I thought it would be a good challenge to try to get a bunch of information for each color of star using the given data set. I came to the idea of getting the averages of the Temperature, Luminosity, Radius, Absolute Magnitude, and Star Type of each star, so that gave me the following steps to complete:

- Make each color be formatted the same so they could be combined ('Blue-White', 'blue-White', 'blue white' are all the same)
- Get the amount of stars for each color
- Add up all the data from stars of the same color and divide the total by the amount of stars of that color

### Result
I was able to do all of this using python. I haven't actually learned python but it is something I have wanted to know, so I thought that this was a good opportunity to try it out. I was able to complete it by making a couple of different arrays, dumping the dataset into an array and then editing it, and going through the array and accessing information to add the numbers I was using.
